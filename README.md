# SVADA-Sonar-Viewer-and-analyzer-diagnostic-application 

Neural Network (FFBP) based application for realtime discovery, classificastion and visualization of anomalies on the sea floor from sonar data. 

Need some thoughts about rewriting this project first, f.ex making it run on a Rasberry Pi, using node.js and docker, using more and different external sensors by using Arduino / ESP32 or other micro conntrollers either by wire or wireless.

But maybe its just to old and outdated. The Original was programmed in C++ with OpenGL, and MATLAB in 1998, by myself and another student and consists of multiple programs and modules. Needs free public raw sonar data for training, as the testdata we used was provided by the Swedish Navy, Im unsure if that is in the public domain.

Test results and scientific publication can be found https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/3728/0000/Wreck-finding-and-classifying-with-a-sonar-filter/10.1117/12.343054.full
